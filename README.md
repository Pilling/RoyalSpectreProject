#RoyalSpectre

**Project: Spectre**  Brief : Vision : Mission


**Vision**

- The cultivation of an online space where visions are shared through the use of visual stimulus and no text.
- A place where people and teams can showcase their creative projects using a single image or a series of images to conceptualise an idea or project which may be purely conceptual, in-flights, or finished. A way to get meaningful traffic to your project web sites.

**Mission**

- What will the app try to achieve?
  - Image based app for creatives to display their projects or vision using a single image or a series of images.
  - Users can give images 'nods' which are like 'likes' to concepts/images are they like or that speaks to them. *'If you nod at a piece of work, let them know, give them a Nod'*
  - The image can be accompanied by only a single URL to find more about the project/concept/vision if they choose
  - Uploads can be accompanied by 3 keywords to categorise the image(s) into broad topics
  - There will be a tab with the most 'nods' for popular image(s), which can also be sorted by category.
  
  **Functions**

- Image upload and storage (single and series)
- Likes storage in the form of 'Nods'
- Sorting through pre-determined 'tags' or 'keywords'
